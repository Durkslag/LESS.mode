A LESS Syntax Mode For Coda

This is a syntax mode for the LESS language for the OS X text editor Coda.

ToDo:
Code clean up
Fix color for 2nd and higher mixin syntax not showing properly.
Fix correct syntax when selectors are followed by curly brackets. For example "a:hover {"
Make the SyntaxDefinition.xml file smaller w/o repetitive data.
