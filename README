A LESS Syntax Mode For Coda

This is a syntax mode for the LESS language for the OS X text editor Coda.

Please be aware that this is still in beta.
This means that not all syntax are correct yet and the code itself isn't as beautiful as I'd like it to be.
Everything else should work great though. Try it out!

ToDo:
Code clean up
Fix color for 2nd and higher mixin syntax not showing properly.
Fix correct syntax when selectors are followed by curly brackets. For example "a:hover {"
Make the SyntaxDefinition.xml file smaller w/o repetitive data.
